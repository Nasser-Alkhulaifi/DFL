# Decision-Focused Learning for Batteries Energy Efficiency

Welcome to the repository for the **Energy Storage Forecasting and Optimisation: A Comprehensive Study of Decision-Focused Learning Compared to Predict-Then-Optimise Using Real-World Battery Data** paper. This research explores the application of DFL to optimise battery charging strategies in residential settings, aiming to reduce energy costs and improve efficiency.


## Introduction

Traditional machine learning approaches often separate prediction and decision-making processes, which can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to error propagation. **DFL** integrates prediction and optimisation into a single end-to-end learning framework, directly aligning model predictions with decision-making objectives.

In this study, we focus on:

- **Multiple Unknowns**: Predicting future energy prices and household energy demand for the 24-hour horizon.
  - **Q**: **What will energy costs be for the next 24 hours? What levels of demand can be expected?**

- **Decision-Making**: Determining optimal charging times and levels for batteries within the 24-hour forecasting period.
  - **Q**: **When should charging occur during this period? And by how much?**


## Objectives
- **Minimise Energy Costs while meeting the demand**: Optimise battery charging schedules to take advantage of lower electricity prices (The energy prices are updated daily betweem 4-8pm for the following 24 hours, starting at 11 pm).


## Dataset
The dataset includes:

- **Batteries and Household Demand Data** (sourced from Intelligent Plant: https://www.intelligentplant.com)
- **Energy Prices** (sourced Octopus Energy API https://developer.octopus.energy/rest/guides/api-basics).
